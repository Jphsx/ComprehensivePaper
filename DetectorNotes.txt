chapter 5 is about WW production wrt helicity in ivan thesis

The use of longitudinally polarized beams plays a major role in reducing the background
contribution as much as possible, while enhancing the signal rates. This is particularly
important for searches for new physics, where the signal contribution is often expected
to be extremely small compared to the SM background.
