Origins:
Linear collider discussed as next step for HEP as early as 1978

1994 Tigner writes paper for future of part physics, next frontier has to be linear collider because of synchotron
proposes many competing projects like SLC, TESLA, CLIC, NLC, GLC

some time around 2001 projects are consolidated into ILC
ILC starts gaining momentum


In August 2004, the International Technology Recommendation Panel (ITRP) recommended[8] a superconducting radio frequency technology for the accelerator. After this decision the three existing linear collider projects – the Next Linear Collider (NLC), the Global Linear Collider (GLC) and Teraelectronvolt Energy Superconducting Linear Accelerator (TESLA) – joined their efforts into one single project (the ILC).

Hon. Paul Dabbar, Under Secretary for Science, US
DOE,
 he would
act as a positive advocator in US
government and congress provided
the Japanese government makes the
decision. 

Mar 2019 "Japan will view the ILC"

"On 7 March 2019, the Japanese government has expressed its position for the International Linear Collider, a proposed particle physics project that would be hosted in the Kitakami mountains in the north of the country. The government has decided to not yet make a proposal to host the project, but has expressed interest in the ILC project and signalled to continue discussing it with other governments."

Mext = Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology
MEXT has not yet reached declaration
for hosting the ILC in Japan at this moment. Nevertheless, “MEXT will continue to discuss the ILC
project with other governments while having an interest in the ILC project.

MEXT and KEK Director-General
Dr. Yamauchi. We visited the government and parliament of Germany and France, and we agreed to set
up ILC discussion groups between Germany and Japan, 

US-Japan cooperation, the Federation of Diet Members for the ILC has had many
meetings since 2013 in Washington DC as well as in Tokyo. Most recently, we had meetings on the ILC
with Under Secretary, the Honorable Paul Dabbar and Office of Science Director, Dr. Chris Fall of the
US Department of Energy.
